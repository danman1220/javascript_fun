		Think of this as the complex plane, and consider the function f(z) = z^2 + c.
		If we pick a value for c, start at zero, and keep plugging in the result to f over and over again,
		which values of c will trap points, and which will cause points to escape? Any point that is black
		got trapped (for example, with c = 0 we iterate f(z) = z^2 at zero over and over again, which stays at zero, so c=0 is 'trapped'),
		and the other colors show how long it took the point to escape (how many times we had to iterate to make it escape).
